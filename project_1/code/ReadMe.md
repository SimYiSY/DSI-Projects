## Conclusions:

**SAT School Day**

The program seems to have a positive impact for SAT participation. States that is part of the program has an average of 73% whereas other states has an average of 36% in 2018.


## Findings:

**Targets for improvement**

There are a few states that we can target to further improve the participation rate of SAT, through additional funding. There is also district that do not require ACT, therefore they may be more willing to opt for SAT School Day Program. 
* District of Columbia: largest decrease of participation rate from 2017 - 2018, 8% drop


* States already in SAT School Day with low 2018 participation: Oklahoma, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia.

  * It is interesting to note that despite having the option to choose between SAT and ACT, the students in Oklahoma, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee has a higher ACT participation as compared to SAT participation. (West Virginia has an West Virginia Alternative Summer Assessment that students can opt for)


* Arkansas and Minnesota has the very low SAT participation rate compared to their high ACT participation in both years despite being offered both test and is not necessary to graduate. We can consider approaching these states to be part of SAT School Day to see if we can increase the participation rate of SAT.

* States with high student debts tend to have higher sat participation rate, as SAT school day offer free SAT test.


## Recommendations:

Ideally I would look for states that has a higher student debt and has low SAT participation(provided that ACT is not mandatory in the said state)

My recommended state will be Ohio, the reason being:
* Low SAT participation, despite being part of SAT school day.
* Not compulsory to take the ACT, but have to take either test to graduate
* High student debt, would be more willing to take part in SAT school day
* Has low SAT participation, therefore higher chance of participation growth
* Unlike Minnesota, Ohio requires their students to take either ACT or SAT to graduate.
